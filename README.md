### Analysis to HTTP API

I WANT THE DATA!

Sometimes the output we seek from an analysis isn't really ready for human
consumption and the best thing to do is just return the raw data back to the
user.  HTTP APIs are a great way to allow people (or programs) access to an
analysis in a way that gives them the freedom to decide how to use the results.
If you're not familiar with HTTP APIs, this gentle introduction will show you
how you can use the Plumber package to quickly put together some HTTP APIs to
allow others to run your models with their own data and get the raw results
back.

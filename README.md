### Analysis to Web Application

You've done the hard work of developing a model and now you're the go to person
for performing the analysis. Empower others to quickly get started using your
model by turning it into a web application. Not a HTML and JavaScript wizard?
No problem. The Shiny library lets you write R code to put develop the
interface to accept inputs from the user, tie it to your analysis, and
visualize the outputs.

### Analysis to HTTP API

I WANT THE DATA!

Sometimes the output we seek from an analysis isn't really ready for human
consumption and the best thing to do is just return the raw data back to the
user.  HTTP APIs are a great way to allow people (or programs) access to an
analysis in a way that gives them the freedom to decide how to use the results.
If you're not familiar with HTTP APIs, this gentle introduction will show you
how you can use the Plumber package to quickly put together some HTTP APIs to
allow others to run your models with their own data and get the raw results
back.
